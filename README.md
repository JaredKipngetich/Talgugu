# Hello_World
Today a civil and construction engineer sets sail into the world of programming. The goal is to explore the wonders, depths and reaches of this newly discovered gift and to leverage it with my extensive knowlege of engineering to solve real world problems. May the will and purpose of Him who never sleeps prevail, may the works of my hands be sweet and may I establish authority over this gift.
